# Patient Clustering and Prediction of Flipped Patients

- Removed outliers using box plots.
- Used K-Means clustering to categorize patients into three distinct groups 
- Determined the variables responsible for most of the variation using Principal Component Analysis 
- Created models to predict whether patients will flip from the Observation unit to an Inpatient Unit or be discharged 
- Used Logistic Regression, Classification Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine to build said models 
- Determined the best model by comparing the ROC curves of each method
